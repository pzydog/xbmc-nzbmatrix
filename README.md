This addon for [xbmc.org](http://xbmc.org/) enables you to stream movies, TV shows and documentaries from [NZBMatrix](http://nzbmatrix.com/).

[xbmc-pneumatic](https://github.com/TsUPeR/xbmc-pneumatic) addon is needed for this to work. You can find the installation instructions [here](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=97657)

Features
--------
* Add NZB files to library
* View/add/delete bookmarks
* Scrapes metadata from [TMDB](http://www.themoviedb.org/) (optional)
* Setting to display scene names or normal names
* Search in all categories

Notes
-----
* Metadata is not available for every movie because the data provided by NZBMatrix isn't very consistent.
